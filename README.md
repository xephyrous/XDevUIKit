### What is XDevUIKit?

XDevUIKit, referred to colloquially as XGooey, is Xephyrous's in-house UI development library for Compose Multiplatform. XGooey contains custom components, 
layouts, and utilities designed to increase the speed of app development, while keeping a nice look and feel with plenty of customizeability.

### Installation

XGooey's main repository is setup as a Compose Desktop project, meaning once you clone it, you can get straight to developing!
Otherwise there are dedicated repositories for each specific target ([IOS](), [Android](), [Web]()), along with a repository
containing the library itself without any bloat or examples ([XGooey]()). Further down the road, there will be a web-based project
builder for mixing targets and settings, similar to the [Compose Multiplatform WIzard](https://kmp.jetbrains.com/).
